# react-textinput
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) text input. Exports a commonjs module that can be used with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). Source is in ES6 and is compiled down to ES5 using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Usage

### ES6/JSX (Recommended)
The component is written using ES6/JSX therefore Babel is recommended to use it. The below example is based on using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader).
```js
import React from 'react';
import DropdownMenu from 'react-textinput';

export default class BasicExample extends React.Component

  render() {
    return (
      <TextInput
        label='Username...'
        onChange={this.handleChange} />
    );
  }
}
```

## Examples and Development
More examples can be found in the `examples/` folder. A development server can be run with:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

which will live reload any changes you make and serve them at http://localhost:8080.

### Webpack Configuration
This module is designed to be used with webpack but requires a few loaders if you are pulling the source into another project.

```shell
$ npm install webpack babel-loader css-loader style-loader postcss-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin postcss-nested postcss-color-hex-alpha postcss-color-function postcss-calc postcss-simple-vars autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Below are is a sample of how to setup the loaders:

```js
/**
 * Relevant Webpack Configuration
 */
{
  [...]
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // Setup support for ES6
      {
        test: /\.(jsx?|es6)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel'
      },
      // Setup support for CSS Modules
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style-loader', 'css-loader?modules&importLoaders=1&localIdentName=[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]!postcss-loader')
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    // Extract the css and put it in one file. Path is relative to output path
    new ExtractTextPlugin('../css/[name].css', { allChunks: true })
  ],
  // CSS Modules
  postcss: [
    require('postcss-nested'),
    require('postcss-simple-vars') {
      variables: {
        'base-grid-size' : '4px',
        'primary-color' : '#5e8aaa',
        'accent-color' : '#38b889',
        'warning-color' : '#d43c36',
        'success-color' : '#50a111',
        'primary-font-color': '#333',
        'inverse-font-color': '#fff',
        'primary-background-color' : '#fff'
      }
    },
    require('postcss-color-hex-alpha'),
    require('postcss-color-function'),
    require('postcss-calc'),
    require('autoprefixer')
  ],
  [...]
}
```
